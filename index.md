Welcome to Covid-35
{: .fs-9 }

COVID-35 is a classroom pandemic response simulation game in which participants take on the role of national leaders of countries faced with a pandemic. The aim of the game is to reinforce for participants the idea that leaders face a very complex policy-making environment in which social, economic, public health and political considerations are interconnected. The game divides players into teams and in each turn of play, participants must respond to the developing situation with a selection of policy options. Players will interact with the game through a web application and at the end of every turn, they will be able to see the impact of their decisions through interactive graphs and tables.
