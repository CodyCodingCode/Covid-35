# Submitting Your Turn

Once your team has decided upon a course of action for the current turn, you can submit your turn by clicking on the Submit Turn button at the bottom of the page.

If you don't have enough points to spend, you will be met with an error message.

If you manage to successfully submit your turn, you should get a pop-up notifying you that your turn has been submitted and to wait for other teams.

Once each team has submitted their turn, gameplay for the next turn can begin.

If you try submitting multiple times during the same turn, you will get a warning telling you to wait for other teams before playing your next turn.
