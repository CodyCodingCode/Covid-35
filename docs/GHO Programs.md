# Global Health Organization Programs

The GHO uses ARPs to fund targeted programs that assist different countries, and programs must either be paid for every turn, or simply require an initial activation 
cost. The programsâ€™ effects vary, from increasing ICU capacity to reducing the transmission rate of COVID-35. 
A detailed list of GHO programs, their cost, and effects on subscribing countries are shown in the table below.
The GHO is able to bank ARP points, meaning that any surplus at the end of a turn is carried over to the next, and so on. 
This represents the gradual accumulation of funding over time until a new program can be launched.
