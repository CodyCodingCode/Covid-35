Edresh is a small country of 5 million people who are split into three dominant ethnic groups who have a history of conflict with one another - a conflict that was exacerbated and exploited by the former colonial power Swacor. While there has not been any large-scale violence in the past decade, there are still tensions between the different groups. While women in Edresh fulfill many cultural and formal leadership positions, they also remain primarily responsible for childcare and other forms of unpaid work and are poorer on average than men. Over 30% of the population in Edresh is under 35 years old.

The health system is completely inadequate and what services are available are dependent on external donor support. Due to a lack of health professionals, there is high reliance on community-based health workers and traditional health providers to provide primary care. Maternal and child mortality rates are among some of the worst in the world, particularly in the most rural regions.

Edresh is a liberal democracy but its key parties reflect ethnic divisions more than political ideologies. Past elections have led to violence between opposing sides, though the last two have been relatively peaceful. Those in power maintain it through patronage systems that see benefits distributed among their supporters, as opposed to the general population. There is a high level of corruption and lack of transparency.

The country has low per-capita GDPs and standards of living. It primarily produces cash crops like cotton and tobacco for export, and regularly requires external support to avoid food crises caused by drought. There is a small extractive industry for precious gems, but little other forms of formal employment, with the vast majority of Edreshans working in the informal agriculture and trading sectors.

The border between Edresh and Pansong is porous with many informal traders moving back and forth to exchange goods.

Due to economic constraints and challenges obtaining visas, the majority of Edreshans do not regularly travel internationally, with the exception of the border region with Pansong. However due to former colonial ties, it is not uncommon for Edreshâ€™s most wealthy families to send their children to Swacor for university or work. Edresh typically supports international organizations such as the GHO and is frequently a beneficiary of its programs. It often seeks to work in partnership with more wealthy nations, while seeking to maintain its autonomy and avoid external interference in its affairs. While it embraces international norms around human rights and international law, in practice, governance is based on the interests of the ruling elites.
