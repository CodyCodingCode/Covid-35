Giladon is a lower income country of 25 million people with an agriculturally based economy, including a mix of subsistence and cash crops. With a large coastline, many coastal villages rely on subsistence fishing that sometimes results in tensions due to competition from the much larger, better resourced commercial fishing fleets of Theurus and Mepria. The country is heavily indebted and reliant of foreign aid to maintain basic services like education and for infrastructure development, like roads. The majority of people live off of less than $2 a day. The country often experiences drought and is at high risk of food insecurity.

While there are a number of different ethnic groups and religious groups in Giladon, they coexist harmoniously, with a high degree of intermarriage. Recent advances have seen a closing of gaps between girls’ and boys’ education levels, as well as the increasing role of women in positions of power. Rural communities tend to be structured as chiefdoms (with both men and women serving as chiefs) with traditional norms honoured more often than formal laws.

Giladon’s health system is insufficient to meet needs, particularly those related to a high prevalence of malaria, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases. There are few hospitals and health professionals in rural areas, and facilities in urban areas lack basic technology and supplies. A large portion of healthcare is provided by traditional healers and midwives.
Giladon is home to many international non-governmental organizations run by a mix of national and international professional staff working across a broad range of social and economic sectors. These organizations and the communities they work in frequently rely on the provision of aid and supplies from abroad to meet their basic needs.

Giladon has had the same “democratically elected” leader for over two decades. It is, however, a relatively peaceful country (as long as you are not an opposition politician, as they tend to “disappear”). The ruling elite have consolidated the wealth that is earned from cash crop exports to benefit themselves, and there are numerous complaints from an increasingly active civil society of corruption.

Giladon invests very few resources in monitoring or enforcing its borders and relies heavily on the border policies and resources of neighbouring Theurus and Mepria. Links to the global economy are essential in order to earn foreign exchange from cash crops, and so the ruling elite can maintain their position of power.
