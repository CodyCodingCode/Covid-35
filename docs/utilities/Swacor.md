Swacor considers itself to be one of the most powerful countries in the world and Swacorns are proud of this global status, even if there is much conflict among them. The diverse population of 50 million suffers from a history that has privileged a white upper class at the expense of people of other races and the working class. In recent years this has led to widespread protest, which occasionally turn violent, both by those demanding equality and those protecting their own interests. Within this society, women of colour are particularly disadvantaged and discriminated against, and white men continue to fulfill the majority of powerful positions. Over 25% of the population is over 50 years of age.

The healthcare system is well-developed and resourced, but profit-driven, resulting in gross inequities in access to basic services. Consequently, there is a high incidence of preventable health issues and non- communicable diseases, including obesity, diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure. Health outcomes are particularly stratified by race and ethnicity
With a high GDP Swacor is a wealthy nation but has a growing difference between the wealthy and those living in poverty, and a shrinking middle class. Citizens are highly indebted, and there are few social supports to provide for those who are unemployed (which is about 12 percent of the population). The economy is diverse, based on a healthy mix of resource extraction, manufacturing and agriculture. As one of the world’s largest consumer markets, Swacor is influential in international trade negotiations.

Swacor is a democracy but recent struggles within its two-party system have resulted in widespread public dissatisfaction with the government and the rise of populous movements. The current leader regularly ignores the laws he is supposed to uphold and has taken steps to curtail democratic freedoms. Recent protests about racial and economic inequities have been either dismissed by the ruling elite as representing “minority” interests or responded to with force.

Swacor’s borders are well protected, as it prioritizes its sovereignty and military might, but also designed to ensure the free flow of goods. While a significant portion of Swacorns only travel domestically, the country is a desirable destination for tourists from other countries, as well as for international students pursuing post-secondary degrees. Swacor is also home to several multinational companies and international organization’s headquarters, employing professionals from many of its neighbouring countries. There have been recent tensions over the high number of people from Edresh and Pansong who enter Swacor without the official permits in order to look for work.

Swacor is often dismissive of the GHO and other international actors, preferring to use its considerable military and economic might to influence global affairs unilaterally. It sees a rules-based international order as an attempt to curtail its interests. For this reason, Swacor cannot donate to GHO programs.

Swacor has a longstanding rivalry with Mepria and seeks to keep other countries from becoming too closely aligned to Mepria. Swacor should refuse to provide any aid to countries that have already accepted assistance from Mepria.  The idea of providing any aid to Mepria would be politically unthinkable.
