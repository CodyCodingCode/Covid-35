Theurus is a relatively peaceful country of 35 million people. About 25% of the population is over 50 years of age. The population is ethnically and culturally diverse, living in relative harmony, although incidents of racism towards recent migrants have increased slightly over the past five years. Theurusians pride themselves on respecting human rights and having progressive attitudes regarding gender equality. 

Theurus is a liberal democracy with two dominant political parties and several less popular but still influential parties. Elections occur every four years and have always been deemed fair and peaceful. The country’s Constitution guarantees a range of basic rights and freedoms regardless of sex, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, ability or religion. While the majority of political and business leaders are men from the dominant race, there is increasing diversity in the country’s leadership.
Theurus has one of the best public health systems in the world. While there are wait times for specialized surgeries, primary care services are readily available. Urban populations are served better than people living in rural areas who may have to travel to access healthcare. All citizens, and those with valid residency or work permits, have access to universal health coverage.

Theurus has a highly globalized economy. It is heavily dependent on resource extraction (e.g., fossil fuels, mining, forestry, fisheries), and, to a lesser degree, agriculture (e.g., fruit, wheat). It exports raw materials to key trading partners, Mepria and Swacor, in exchange for imports of manufactured goods. Furthermore, its economy is highly dependent on the movement of people across its border, governed by a national system of work, study and tourist visas, which is administered effectively through its Central Borders Department. The tourism sector generates 10% of the country’s GDP and the country relies heavily on foreign visitors to sustain the services sector. Theurus also imports seasonal labour from Edresh and Giladon for its extractive and agricultural sectors.
Because of the country’s vast natural resources, the country enjoys one of the world’s highest per capita GDP and thus high standards of living. The majority of citizens enjoy a middle-class lifestyle, but the gap between the rich and poor has increased over the past 25 years. Unemployment is around six percent of the population.

Theurusians pride themselves on being global citizens and 65% of the population have travelled abroad for work or vacation in the past 5 years. Theurus gives about 1.7 percent of its GDP for international development assistance. It is an active, if less influential, member state of international organizations, reflecting its support for a rules-based world order. Desiring a stronger role in international affairs, Theurus is willing to provide international assistance in times of crisis worldwide, but has to balance this altruism against domestic pressures to maintain the conditions for the high standard of living most of its citizens enjoy.
