# GHO

![GHO Flag](https://github.com/CodyCodingCode/Covid-35/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/GHO_flag.png?raw=true)

The Global Health Organisation (GHO) is governed by the Global World Health Assembly (GWHA), made up of 194 member states. The Executive Board, made up of 34 individuals with expertise in global health, provides guidance and management.

The GHO’s general program budget has been largely stagnant for the last 25 years, and the organization’s general operations are chronically underfunded. Donor countries and private actors prefer to fund special project budgets, which they have more control over.

The GHO is responsible for implementing and enforcing the International Health Regulations (IHR), revised by the GWHA in 2005. The IHR are legally binding, requiring states to develop core preparedness capacities and to report outbreaks to the GHO. However, the GHO has little recourse when states fail to honor obligations.

The IHR provide the GHO with the authority to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). A PHEIC is defined as, “an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response.” Declaring a PHEIC generally results in global recognition of and mobilization to respond to a health emergency.

Within the game, the GHO will seek transfers of resources from the countries of Zecan to deliver additional GHO programs addressing the pandemic, and especially to assist the lower income countries.
