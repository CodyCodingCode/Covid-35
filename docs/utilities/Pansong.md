Pansong is a country of 40 million people who are relatively homogenous ethnically, but which suffers from divisions between the majority and minority religion and class discrimination. There are frequent protests and demonstrations and have been isolated incidents of religiously motivated violence. Women’s rights, though enshrined in law, are routinely violated with high rates of gender-based violence and the routine exploitation of women’s labour. While traditionally more communally based, the culture has become increasingly individualistic due to the increase in foreign media and globalized economy.

The health system is tiered with well-resourced private care for the minority who can afford it, and grossly under resourced public healthcare for the rest. The vast majority of primary care is provided by community health workers, 98% of whom are women, who visit the ill in the urban slums and rural areas providing basic medications and treatments. The recent decade has seen a growing burden of disease related to non-communicable diseases, such as heart disease and strokes.

A middle-income country, Pansong’s economy is based on a mix of agriculture, technology and tourism. While there is still a notable gap between the minority “haves” and majority “have-nots”, the middle class is slowly growing. A comparatively large percentage of Pansongans live in other countries and send remittances home to support relatives.

Pansong has a democratically elected government. The current government represents the interests of the upper-class religious majority and has done more to stoke religious tensions than diffuse them. There is a strong civil society that frequently critiques and monitors government actions.

Pansong generally supports global co-operative efforts and aims to assert its global position through multilateral forums but has only limited domestic resources to invest globally. It welcomes partnership opportunities with more wealthy states, particularly if there are opportunities to grow its technology industries and improve its health and education system. While usually willing to sign on to global agreements and proclamations regarding human rights, it continues to violate such agreements domestically - particularly in terms of the rights of religious minorities and women.

Pansong has a long-standing conflict with Mepria and therefore that border is heavily guarded and sees low levels of cross-border movement. However, the rest of its border relations are designed to facilitate trade and the free movement of people.
