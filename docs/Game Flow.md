## Policy Control Measures
Covid-35 provides each country-team with four policy measures in which they can act

These measures impact a countryâ€™s economic outlook, infection level (new infections, deaths, and ICU utilization rate), vaccination rates, and government popularity; their impacts are shaped by the policy level selected, which in order of least to most restrictive are green, yellow, orange, and red. More restrictive levels, e.g. red, are the most effective at suppressing the infection, but will also produce the strongest negative externalities such as decrease in government popularity and economic outlook. Thus, players must manage the trade-offs between managing the pandemic through the use of their various policy measures, and their negative externalities. 

Below are tables that present a summary of each policy measure, the chosen restriction level and their impacts. These tables can also be accessed in game by clicking on the yellow "Info" box.
