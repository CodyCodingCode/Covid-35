# Game Flow
{: .no_toc }

Once players have successfully joined a game, they will be met with a control panel from which they can play the game.


There are several key sections to the control panel:

### [Chat](https://codycodingcode.github.io/Covid-35/docs/Login/#login)
### [Policy Control Measures](https://codycodingcode.github.io/Covid-35/docs/Policy%20Measures/)
### [ARP Expenditure](https://codycodingcode.github.io/Covid-35/docs/Login/#login)
### [Foreign Policy Entry Form](https://codycodingcode.github.io/Covid-35/docs/Login/#login)
### [Advanced Stats](https://codycodingcode.github.io/Covid-35/docs/Login/#login)
