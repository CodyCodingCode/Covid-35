# Covid-35 Variant

A Covid-35 variant can be introduced by game administrators at any time. The variant will be at half-strength the turn after which it is introduced and full-strength
after two turns.

The variant effects infection rates and will make Covid-35 stronger across the board. Once the variant is released, expect higher mortality rates, hospitalization rates,
ICU rates and more, so plan ahead accordingly.
