# Vaccines

The game has the facility to represent the delivery of vaccines. Vaccines have the effect of reducing transmission and reducing the proportion of 
infected people who require hospitalisation. Each national vaccine programme will take a number of months to roll out and has a maximum uptake level. 
By default the vaccines become available after 1 year from the beginning of the pandemic. In high-income countries the rollout will 
take 6 months, in middle income countries 12 months and in low-income countries 18 months. 

The GHO can invest in vaccine Research and Development which can advance the start date of the vaccine by 1 week per ARP spent.

Each individual country can also increase both their vaccine uptake as well as speed up vaccine rollout by investing in varying levels of national Healthcare Measures.
