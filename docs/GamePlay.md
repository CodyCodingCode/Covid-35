# Game Play

The game is broken down into turns. Each turn represents 2 months and has 3 phases.

### Domestic Discussion and Global Coordination Phase
Players will communicate within their own country-team as well as with other teams

•	Domestic Discussion: Each country-team will discuss the desired set of policies they wish to implement in the current turn. 

•	Global Coordination: The designated foreign minister of each government will meet other foreign ministers and the GHO to discuss the sharing of ARPs, 
vaccine funding, and GHO funding. These discussions can be bilateral or multilateral as per each team’s desires; multilateral discussions can be headed by the 
GHO player who will lead and facilitate the global discussions.

### Decision Phase
Each team will submit their turns through the user form for the respective turn. 
If the GHO has received donor funding, the GHO player will decide which programs to implement

### Results Phase
Each team will have a chance to look at end of turn graphs by going into the advanced stats tab. The graphs will illustrate each country's end-of-turn performance.
