# Foreign Policy Entry Form

ARP's can be transferred amongst each team using the Foreign Policy Entry Form.

![Foreign Form](https://github.com/CodyCodingCode/Covid-35/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/Foreign_Form.jpg?raw=true)

Country-teams can solicit ARP transfers from other country-teams, but will need to convince them to do so, especially as Low-Income countries and the GHO are 
largely dependent on ARP transfers from wealthier countries. In addition, solicited ARPs only become usable in the following turn.

Keep in mind that unused ARP's due not persist to the next turn and that potentially the best course of action could be to help either neighboring countries or the
GHO instead of spending all ARP's locally.
