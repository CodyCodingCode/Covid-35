# Administrative Resource Points

### Expenditure
Administrative Resource Points (ARPs) represent a government’s capability and capacity to act, and it is a proxy for political capital, administrative capacity, 
and level of economic development. ARPs are used for the following purposes:
•	Enact or maintain various policy measures.
•	Transfer ARP to either the GHO or other country-teams. 
•	The GHO can use ARPs to speed up vaccine development, enact health programs, or transfer them to countries in need.
ARPs limit the courses of actions which can be undertaken in a given turn, and are thus meant to promote complex decision-making since each team must consider how 
to use their limited ARPs: for example, should they enact tough policies to suppress transmission of the coronavirus -and if so, which ones- or should they transfer 
them to another country or the GHO who are in need of support?
Country-teams must pay the associated ARP cost to enact their policies, as desired policies cannot be enacted if their ARP is insufficient. 

### Income
Each country-team is allocated varying amounts of ARPs at the start of each turn, as a reflection of their level of economic development, with HICs, for example, 
typically receiving more ARPs than LICs. The difference in ARP earnings is reflective of how LICs’ responses to COVID-19 are limited by financial and institutional 
constraints (Gurara et al, 2020; Josephson et al, 2021, p.557). The GHO starts the game with three ARPs which represent funding by donor countries prior to the start 
of the game, but must continually lobby country-teams for ARP transfers to represent the WHO’s reliance on voluntary contributions from donor states 
(Reddy et al, 2018, p.3).

### Transfer
Country-teams can solicit ARP transfers from other country-teams, but will need to convince them to do so, especially as LICs and the GHO are largely dependent on 
ARP transfers from wealthier countries. In addition, solicited ARPs only become usable in the following turn.

### Bankability and Reserve
ARPs are non-bankable, meaning they cannot be saved for the following turn, in order to force players to grapple with the best course of action in every turn rather 
than stockpiling their ARPs for a rainy day.  Players have access to a non-refillable emergency ARP reserve which can be deployed at any time since they may encounter 
situations, e.g. an uncontrolled outbreak, which warrant the use of extraordinary measures.

### ARP Modifiers
The amount of ARPs that players receive in a given turn can be affected by changes to government popularity compared to the popularity at the start of the game: 
a 15% increase in government popularity will provide +1 ARP while a 15% decrease will lead to a loss of an ARP. For example, a 15% increase in government popularity 
in Turn Five when compared to Turn Zero will provide +1 ARP to that country-team in Turn Six. The rationale is that lower government popularity imposes constraints on 
a government’s freedom of action, as it limits what actions the public is willing to tolerate and as the government must use its scarce resources to address political 
challenges against it; conversely, higher government popularity increases a government’s freedom of action.
